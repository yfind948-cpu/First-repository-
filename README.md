Create a single standalone, mobile-friendly HTML file (one file only) for a 4-page digital birthday greeting for a boy named ZAID KHAN. Requirements:

- Theme: modern blue & white with gold sparkle accents. Use premium script for the name and a clean sans for body text. Include Google Fonts (e.g., Great Vibes + Poppins).
- Layout: four pages in one file (use sections or pages that can be navigated with Next/Back or dots).
- Page 1 (Welcome splash): large glowing title "Happy Birthday ZAID KHAN" in premium script with subtle animation, sparkling confetti animation (canvas or CSS), short poetic line: "Today the stars shine brighterâ€¦ because itâ€™s your day." Include a play/pause music button that toggles an energetic track (loop). Use placeholder URL `{{MUSIC_URL}}` so I can replace it later.
- Page 2 (Scrapbook): a warm scrapbook-style collage (2x2) with image placeholders `{{IMAGE1}}`, `{{IMAGE2}}`, `{{IMAGE3}}`, `{{IMAGE4}}`. Each image should have a caption area and a thin classic dark-blue frame with slight gold inner border.
- Page 3 (Poem): show the supplied poem in an elegant handwritten style, centered, with a subtle floating-balloon or falling-petal animation in the background:
  Another year, another light,
  Shining in your soul so bright,
  Dreams take flight, the skies unfold,
  Your heart a story, yet untold.

  May laughter bloom like morning dew,
  And every wish come running to you,
  In joy, in love, may you always stay,
  A star that brightens every day. âœ¨
- Page 4 (Final / Gift): fireworks animation and a clear CTA button: "Your birthday gift is here!" that opens `{{GIFT_LINK}}` in a new tab. Then closing line: "The world is better with you in it. Happy Birthday once again!" Include a looping "Thank You" micro-animation and fade out the music when this page opens.
- Visual details: consistent blue & white palette, gold sparkle highlights, responsive, mobile-first. Name "ZAID KHAN" should have a subtle entrance animation on page 1.
- Accessibility: add alt text placeholders for images, keyboard navigation (left/right arrows), and aria labels for main UI controls.
- Delivery: Return the full HTML/CSS/JS in a single code block so I can copy and save as `index.html`. Do not put external build steps. Use CDN Google Fonts only. Use image/music placeholders exactly as `{{IMAGE1}}`, `{{IMAGE2}}`, `{{IMAGE3}}`, `{{IMAGE4}}`, `{{MUSIC_URL}}`, `{{GIFT_LINK}}` so I can replace them easily.

End.
